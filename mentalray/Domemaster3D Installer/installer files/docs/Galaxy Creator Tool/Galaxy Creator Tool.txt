Galaxy Creator Tool
Version 1.0 - May 17, 2013

The galaxy creator tool is an addon for the Domemaster3D Toolset. The tool helps create dynamic galaxies. 

The Galaxy Creator tool is a new GUI for Martin Watt's classic galaxies.mel script.

Installation
-------------
If you are running Maya 2010 installed the files in the "Maya 2010 files" folder.

For Maya 2011+ use the maay 2011+ files folder.

Install the script, icons, and self items. You need to replace the existing domemaster3D shelf to get the new galaxy creator tool.


Operation
----------
Click on the galaxy icon in the Domemaster3D shelf to run the tool.

You can set the size and look of the galaxy using the GUI tools.

The Galaxy Orientation control sets what view the galaxy is poisitoned in: Top/Front/Right

Here are a few galaxy values you can try out:

Galaxy #1
 Spiral 1:
 Stars: 2000
 Radius: 20
 Spiral Arms: 5 
 Galaxy Turns: 1
 
Ring Galaxy #2:
 Stars: 2000
 Radius: 20
 Spiral Arms: 400 
 Galaxy Turns: 5
 
Circular Galaxy #3
 Stars: 3000
 Radius: 20
 Spiral Arms: 400 
 Galaxy Turns: 10

You can run the Galaxy Creator script multiple times and mix-and match the different galaxies in your scene.

If you delete a spiral galaxy, don't forget to remove the unwanted nucelus particle shape too.

You can stack multiple gaseous spiral gallaxies in the scene and change their colors and particle radius values to get interesting shading effects.

The galaxy shader uses a combined shading group with a particleCloud and surfaceShader to represent the galaxy particle colors. 

The surfaceShader is used for the realtime viewport and the particleCloud is used for the cloud effect in the render view.

The Connect All newtonFields checbox links all of the galaxy newton fields to all of the particles. You can manually control these fields in the Dynamic Relationship Editor window.
