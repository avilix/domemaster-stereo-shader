Mac OS X Installation Notes
--------------------------------

If you are running Mac OS X 10.8 or 10.9 you need to open your System Preferences and adjust the gatekeeper settings to allow all programs to run. This will allow the unsigned Domemaster3D installer to copy the lens shader library into the Mental Ray shaders folder, and create the /Applications/Domemaster3D resource folder.
